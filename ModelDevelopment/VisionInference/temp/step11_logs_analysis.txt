LOGS ANALYSIS - Service Status

✅ SERVICE IS RUNNING SUCCESSFULLY!
- URL: https://vision-inference-api-246542889931.us-central1.run.app
- Health endpoint: Working (200 OK)
- Docs page: Working (200 OK)
- TB predictions: Working (200 OK)

✅ TB MODEL: LOADED SUCCESSFULLY
- Path: gs://medscan-pipeline-medscanai-476500/vision/trained_models/fd90d449-a96c-4604-b567-fe8c92751d51/models/models/2025/11/27/000036/tb_CNN_ResNet18/CNN_ResNet18_final.keras
- Status: Downloaded and loaded successfully

❌ LUNG CANCER MODEL: NOT FOUND
- Expected path pattern: vision/trained_models/{BUILD_ID}/models/models/YYYY/MM/DD/timestamp/lung_cancer_ct_scan*/
- Status: Model not found in GCS
- Impact: /predict/lung_cancer endpoint will fail

⚠️ MINOR ISSUES (not critical):
- CUDA errors (expected - Cloud Run uses CPU only)
- GradCAM warnings (gradients are low, but visualization works)
- Python 3.9 deprecation warning (not critical)

CONCLUSION:
Service is running fine. TB predictions work. Lung cancer predictions won't work until the model is uploaded to GCS.
