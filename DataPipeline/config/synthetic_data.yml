# Synthetic Patient Data Generation Configuration using Faker
# 
# Note: Patient IDs are extracted from preprocessed image filenames.
# The preprocessing scripts (process_tb.py, process_lungcancer.py) 
# automatically generate unique UUID-based Patient IDs (32-character hex strings)
# and use them as image filenames. This generator reads those filenames to
# ensure Patient IDs match between images and metadata.
